# Chat GPT

ChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. Here's a brief overview:

- It was introduced as a "research preview" on November 30, 2022 [Source 3](https://www.techradar.com/news/chatgpt-explained).
- The model is designed to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context provided by the previous text [Source 3](https://www.techradar.com/news/chatgpt-explained).
- It can be used to summarize long articles, research papers, and books, making such tasks easier [Source 0](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-summarize-a-book-article-or-research-paper/).
- The dialogue format of ChatGPT allows it to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests [Source 1](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/).
- It is based on a language model from the GPT-3.5 series, with a more advanced GPT-4 model available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers [Source 3](https://www.techradar.com/news/chatgpt-explained).
- It can't directly browse the internet unless you're a paid subscriber, so you'll need to feed it with the raw material it needs before asking it to generate a summary [Source 2](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-summarize-an-article/).

To interact with ChatGPT, you can use the prompt portal on OpenAI's website or integrate it into your own applications via the API. Here are the URLs you asked for:

- Outline the style of the response (casual, formal, etc.) to ensure it aligns with your brand's identity and communication style [Source 6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2023/09/18/chatgpt-the-9-crucial-components-of-an-effective-prompt/).
- Avoid vague language and be specific about your requirements, preferences, and constraints [Source 6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2023/09/18/chatgpt-the-9-crucial-components-of-an-effective-prompt/).
