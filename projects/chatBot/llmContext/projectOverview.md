Project Overview
TotalRekallAI aspires to propel the recruitment industry into a new era of recruiter training by introducing a sophisticated AI-powered platform. While being a brainchild of Rekall Consulting, the platform is designed to serve recruiters across the spectrum, offering a paid structure to access its training repertoire.

Key Features:
Flexible Access: TotalRekallAI adopts a pay-as-you-use system, where recruiters buy a set amount of training time, alongside subscription models, allowing tailored access based on individual or organisational needs.
Advanced AI Evaluation: Utilising state-of-the-art language models such as a Fine Tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo for fluent conversations, GPT-4 for analysis, and Claude-2-100K with its large 100 000 token context window to keep the context of entire training sessions. Open source self hosted LLMs are also explored in the specification below. TotalRekallAI provides precise evaluation and feedback on recruiters' interactions with simulated executives.
Cost Management: The cost incurred from leveraging advanced language models is managed through a token system, balancing the operational expenses while ensuring the platform's cutting-edge evaluative capabilities.
Impact:
TotalRekallAI is not just a venture to refine the skills of Rekall Consulting's recruiters, but an industry-wide initiative. By providing a platform where recruiters can refine their conversational skills with executives, it's setting a new standard in recruiter training. This initiative is poised to not only generate a new revenue stream for Rekall Consulting but also to foster a community of highly skilled recruiters, thereby enhancing the overall quality and competitiveness within the recruitment industry. Through TotalRekallAI, Rekall Consulting is making strides towards fostering a culture of excellence and continuous improvement among recruiters, which in turn, is anticipated to have a ripple effect on the tech recruitment industry at large.


Summary:
Certainly, Mr. Cronje. You're developing a training system named TotalRekallAI under Rekall Consulting to advance recruiter training for better interactions with CEOs. The platform, open to all recruiters, will use advanced AI for evaluations and offer pay-as-you-use and subscription models.

The project overview has been drafted, emphasizing flexible access, advanced AI evaluation, and a token system for cost management, aiming to elevate industry standards and provide a revenue stream for Rekall Consulting while fostering a skilled recruiter community.
