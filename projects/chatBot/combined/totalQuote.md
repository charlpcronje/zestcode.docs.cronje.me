## Assessment Criteria

This way of training sales staff can be invaluable in many industries, so let's explore how to create personas for a Large Language models and how to assess them.

### Criteria for Assessing Conversations for Training Purposes

#### Assessment criteria for transcribed conversation
*This assessment does not take into account the actual conversation but only what was said, so the tone and verbal ques are not taken into consideration here*

##### 1. Clarity of Introduction (Why: First Impressions)

- **Why**: The introduction sets the tone for the entire conversation. A clear and concise introduction can capture attention and establish credibility.
- **How to Assess**: Evaluate if the introduction clearly states who the caller is, the purpose of the call, and what value they can offer. Use a scale from 1-10 to rate the clarity.

##### 2. Addressing Concerns and Objections (Why: Problem-Solving)

- **Why**: Handling objections effectively is crucial for moving the conversation forward and for problem-solving.
- **How to Assess**: Measure how well the caller addresses concerns and objections raised by the other party. Use specific examples from the conversation to rate this on a 1-10 scale.

##### 3. Persuasiveness (Why: Convincing Power)

- **Why**: The ability to persuade is key to achieving the conversation's objective, whether it's making a sale, setting an appointment, etc.
- **How to Assess**: Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the arguments presented. Rate persuasiveness on a scale of 1-10 based on how compelling the arguments are.

##### 4. Adaptability (Why: Flexibility)

- **Why**: Conversations are dynamic. The ability to adapt to new information or objections is crucial.
- **How to Assess**: Assess how well the caller adapts their approach based on the flow of the conversation. Rate on a scale of 1-10.

##### 5. Question Quality (Why: Information Gathering)

- **Why**: Good questions can provide valuable insights into the other party's needs and concerns.
- **How to Assess**: Evaluate the relevance and depth of the questions asked. Use a 1-10 scale to rate the quality of questions.

##### 6. Active Listening (Why: Understanding and Rapport)

- **Why**: Active listening shows that the caller understands and respects the other party's viewpoint, which helps in building rapport.
- **How to Assess**: Look for signs of active listening such as paraphrasing, asking follow-up questions, or acknowledging the other party's points. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 7. Time Management (Why: Efficiency)

- **Why**: Effective time management respects the other party's time and keeps the conversation focused.
- **How to Assess**: Evaluate if the conversation was concise and if it reached its objectives within a reasonable time frame. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 8. Closing Skills (Why: Conclusion and Next Steps)

- **Why**: A strong close can summarize the conversation and set the stage for future interactions.
- **How to Assess**: Assess how well the conversation was concluded and if next steps or commitments were clearly established. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

### Summary

These eight criteria cover essential aspects of a conversation, from the introduction to the conclusion. They are designed to provide a comprehensive assessment that can be scaled to evaluate hundreds of conversations.

### Assessment criteria for actual conversation content
*This assessment is more focused on how the conversation was handled and less about the exact content*

##### 1. Tone and Vocal Quality (Why: Emotional Impact)

- **Why**: The tone of voice can convey emotions and attitudes that text cannot, affecting the listener's perception and engagement.
- **How to Assess**: Evaluate the tone for warmth, confidence, and sincerity. Use a 1-10 scale to rate the vocal quality and emotional impact.

##### 2. Pacing (Why: Comprehension and Comfort)

- **Why**: Speaking too fast or too slow can affect the listener's ability to comprehend and feel comfortable during the conversation.
- **How to Assess**: Listen for a pace that matches the complexity of the information being shared. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 3. Use of Silence (Why: Thoughtfulness and Respect)

- **Why**: Effective use of silence can indicate thoughtfulness, give the other party time to think, and can be a powerful tool in persuasion.
- **How to Assess**: Evaluate how well silence is used to emphasize points or allow for reflection. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 4. Audibility and Clarity (Why: Basic Communication)

- **Why**: If the speaker is not audible or clear, the message will be lost, regardless of its quality.
- **How to Assess**: Assess the volume and enunciation of the speaker. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 5. Interruption Handling (Why: Respect and Flow)

- **Why**: How interruptions are handled can affect the flow of the conversation and indicate the level of respect between parties.
- **How to Assess**: Note instances of interruptions and how they are managed by both parties. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 6. Verbal Affirmations (Why: Engagement)

- **Why**: Simple affirmations like "I see," "understood," or "go on" can indicate active listening and engagement.
- **How to Assess**: Count the instances of verbal affirmations and assess their appropriateness. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 7. Non-Verbal Sounds (Why: Subtext)

- **Why**: Sounds like sighs, laughter, or pauses can provide context and subtext that text cannot convey.
- **How to Assess**: Evaluate the impact of non-verbal sounds on the conversation's tone and meaning. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

##### 8. Call Technical Quality (Why: Seamless Interaction)

- **Why**: Poor call quality can disrupt the flow of conversation and cause misunderstandings.
- **How to Assess**: Note any instances of call drops, static, or other technical issues and how they impacted the conversation. Rate on a 1-10 scale.

# Assessment Models Implemention & Expected Data

## 1. Tone and Vocal Quality (SER)

## SER Output
The SER model usually classifies emotions into predefined categories such as "Happy," "Sad," "Angry," "Neutral," etc., based on the features extracted from the audio signal. These features can include pitch, energy, and formants, among others. The output might look something like this:

```json
{
  "Happy": 0.7,
  "Sad": 0.1,
  "Angry": 0.1,
  "Neutral": 0.1
}
```

Here, the numbers represent the probability or confidence level that the model has in its classification. In this example, the model is 70% confident that the tone is "Happy."

Translating to Ratings
To translate this into a rating system for "Tone and Vocal Quality," you could map the emotional categories to the attributes you're interested in, such as warmth, confidence, and sincerity.

**For example:**

- "Happy" and "Neutral" tones could be indicative of warmth.
- "Angry" and "Happy" tones could be indicative of confidence.
- "Neutral" and "Sad" tones could be indicative of sincerity.
- You could then use a weighted average formula to calculate the ratings for each attribute. Here's a simplified example:

## 2. Pacing (Comprehension and Comfort)

### Praat Output
Praat is a tool often used for phonetic analysis, including the measurement of speech rate. It can provide detailed information about the duration of phonemes, syllables, and pauses in the speech. A typical output might look like this:

```json
{
  "PhonemeDuration": [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, ...],
  "SyllableDuration": [0.3, 0.25, 0.35, ...],
  "PauseDuration": [0.4, 0.5, 0.2, ...]
}
```

### Translating to Ratings
To translate this into a rating for "Pacing," you could calculate the average duration of phonemes, syllables, and pauses, and then normalize these values to fit into a 1-10 scale. The idea is to find a pacing score that matches the complexity of the information being shared.


## 3. Use of Silence (Thoughtfulness and Respect)

### VAD Output

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) typically outputs binary flags indicating whether each segment of audio contains voice activity or silence. For example:

```json
{
  "VoiceActivity": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ...]
}
```

Here, 1 indicates voice activity and 0 indicates silence.

### Translating to Ratings

You could calculate the ratio of silence to voice activity and then assess how effectively silence is used for emphasis or reflection.

## 4. Audibility and Clarity (PESQ)

### PESQ Output

PESQ usually outputs a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) between -0.5 and 4.5, where higher scores indicate better quality.

The MOS can be linearly scaled to a 1-10 rating for audibility and clarity.

## 5. Interruption Handling (Rasa)

### Rasa Output

Rasa could be customized to output logs that indicate how interruptions were managed. For example, it could output a count of interruptions and how they were resolved.

### Translating to Ratings

You could rate the conversation based on the number of interruptions and how well they were managed.

## 6. Verbal Affirmations (Wit.ai)

### Wit.ai Output

Wit.ai could output a list of recognized verbal affirmations and their appropriateness in the context.

### Translating to Ratings

You could rate the conversation based on the number and appropriateness of verbal affirmations.
 

## 7. Non-Verbal Sounds (AudioSet)

### AudioSet Output

AudioSet could output a list of recognized non-verbal sounds like sighs, laughter, or pauses, and their impact on the conversation's tone and meaning.

### Translating to Ratings

You could rate the conversation based on the impact of these non-verbal sounds.

## 8. Call Technical Quality (WebRTC)

### WebRTC Output

WebRTC could output metrics like latency, packet loss, and jitter, which could be used to assess call quality.

### Translating to Ratings

You could rate the call based on these technical metrics.

### Updated Quotation and Development Time Estimates with Assessment Models
