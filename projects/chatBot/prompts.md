### Conversation 1: The Initial Cold Call

#### Heading: The Tech Recruiter's Cold Call to the CEO

#### Description:

The CEO of a tech startup receives an unannounced cold call from a tech recruiter. The CEO is between meetings and not pleased about the interruption. The recruiter aims to get the CEO to agree to a contract and a follow-up call with the leadership team. The CEO is skeptical and needs convincing.

#### Full Conversation:

**Tech Recruiter (TR):** Hi, I appreciate you taking the time to chat. I understand you've been utilizing your own network for recruitment. That's a strategy many of my clients employ. However, as your business scales, the challenge of accessing top-tier talent becomes more complex. By collaborating with me and Rekall Consulting, you'll be able to tap into a pool of high achievers you might not have even considered, complementing your existing network.

**CEO:** Yeah, I think that's important. But I want to make sure we're getting the best people for the job.

**TR:** Absolutely, I'm here to ensure just that. In fact, I'm offering you a complimentary service that provides you with a selection of the top candidates available in the market today. You'll have the opportunity to evaluate these candidates alongside those from your network. Naturally, as a savvy businessperson, your primary goal is to secure the best fit for your team. If I present candidates who are head and shoulders above those in your network, wouldn't it make sense to consider them?

**CEO:** Okay, that sounds fair. But we do have an internal recruitment team in place.

**TR:** It's great that you have an internal team. I'm more than willing to work alongside your team. From my experience, internal teams excel in specific areas of recruitment but might face challenges with more specialized roles or certain regions. This is where I can swiftly add value. I specialize in tackling challenging roles and focusing on regions that need a dedicated, expert touch. Additionally, Rekall Consulting offers services beyond candidate sourcing – we provide competitor and market analysis, valuable insights that can be integral during the hiring process.

**CEO:** I appreciate that, but we often work closely with HR for these matters.

**TR:** Understandable. While I'm happy to collaborate with HR, it's important for me to connect with you directly to gain a clear understanding of the type of candidate you need. As a proactive search organization, I thrive on positioning your value proposition in the market to attract top-tier talent. This requires insights that HR might not possess – insights that can only come from engaging with individuals who understand your organization intimately.

**CEO:** Well, HR does have the information and the job brief.

**TR:** I appreciate that HR might have a job brief, but our approach is more direct. We're a search consultancy, which means we reach out to candidates directly within the market. The level of detail and understanding required to effectively present your opportunity to potential candidates goes beyond what's typically covered in a job brief. We're dedicated to ensuring that we effectively communicate your opportunity to the right candidates.

**CEO:** Alright, I'll keep that in mind. But we often keep an eye out for new talent even if we're not hiring immediately.

**TR:** I completely understand. It's wise to remain open to new opportunities. Just to give you a bit more insight into our approach – what types of roles have you found most challenging to fill recently, and how have your internal teams handled them?

#### Summary and Conclusion:

The tech recruiter initiates the conversation, trying to convince the CEO of the value they can add. The CEO is skeptical but willing to listen. The recruiter successfully navigates through the CEO's objections about using their own network, having an internal recruitment team, and working closely with HR. The conversation ends with the recruiter asking an open question about the roles the CEO finds challenging to fill, aiming to build rapport and trust.

### Conversation 2: Discussing Fees and Terms

#### Heading: Navigating the Financial Obstacles

#### Description:

The CEO is cautious about the financial aspects of working with a recruiter. The recruiter needs to justify their fees and terms to get the CEO to agree to a contract.

#### Full Conversation:

**CEO:** We do have preferred suppliers we work with for our recruitment needs.

**TR:** That's understandable. Many companies have preferred suppliers lists. However, Rekall Consulting has often come into play when the existing suppliers haven't delivered exceptional talent. I'd love the opportunity to showcase how we can bring immediate value. Once you've seen the results, we can discuss the possibility of Rekall Consulting becoming part of your preferred suppliers list.

**CEO:** And what about fees? We usually pay around 15%.

**TR:** Rekall Consulting operates as a Search Consultancy, which involves a more thorough process. We actively seek out the best talent in the market, involving a comprehensive process of mapping the market, targeting potential candidates, and engaging with individuals within organizations to ensure the highest quality. I'm confident that once you see the value and benefits our candidates can bring to your business, you'll see the worth in our fee structure.

**CEO:** Well, I don't know if we're ready to hire just yet.

**TR:** I completely understand your position. However, may I ask how this position has come about? Understanding the context can help us identify how we might be of value in the future. Also, could you share how many open positions you currently have headcount sign-off for?

#### Summary and Conclusion:

The recruiter successfully navigates through the CEO's concerns about preferred suppliers and fees. The conversation ends with the recruiter asking an open question about the CEO's current hiring needs, aiming to understand the context better.
