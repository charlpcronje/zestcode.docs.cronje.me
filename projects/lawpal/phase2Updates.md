# Phase 2: User Experience and Interface Improvements

### 2.1. Trustees should not appear, if no trustees entered
If the user has not yet input a Trustee, Trustees should not appear in the Choose a person already in the will drop down menu.  

### 2.2. Don't allow person to be chosen twice (Grey out seleleced)
Once a person has been chosen, then the Choose a person already in the will dropdown should grey out.

### 2.3. Complete details that's already been completed
Also for example as per the video, Marek selected his spouse as a Trustee, on this very page above he had already input her address, but then why does her address not pull through? The purpose of that particular drop down, is to save users re-entering information they have already input. This needs to be remedied.

### 2.4. Prevent users from using same person for both trustees
When Marek selected his spouse as Trustee 1, when he goes to add Trustee 2, his wife should no longer appear, as users should be prevented from using the same person as both trustees.
> Notes: Covered by earlier task

### 2.5. Do not display empty rows in dropdown
As per the video you can see Marek had not completed information, but suddenly there were two empty rows in the drop down list under `Trustees`, do we know why and can this be amended so users do not just end up with a load of empty rows as it looks strange.

### 2.6. I don't want to add a guardian tickbox
Can we add a tick box in `Guardians` to say ‘I don’t want to add a guardian’ as if someone does not want to, then it will appear as incomplete at the `review` stage.

### 2.7. Edit must take user to the correct place
Pets page link - If you press `edit` next to `Guardians` it takes you to the right place, but if we press `edit` next to `Pets` then it takes you to the `Guardians` page for children but it should take you to the exact page that needs completing, in this case, if you press `edit` next to `Pets` it should take you to the `Pets` page.

### 2.8. Again link to correct place
When a user presses `Edit` next to (what will now be labelled `Survivorship`) it should take you to exactly the page that needs editing / populating not the page before it or the advice page etc – just directly to where the user needs to complete info to avoid confusion.

### 2.9. Fix back button at Guardians
When you get to `Guardians` (do you have any pets page) the `back` button does not work (seems to work with the other variations, just not when choosing a variation `without children`.
