# Phase 3: Enhancing User Interface and Functionality

### 3.1. Animations to be integrated at Who inherits
Who inherits? Animations to be integrated here with the logos and info, not clear whether anything needs to be done on this page, bolder and better colouration, maybe an arrow animating in pointing to the `next` button

### 3.2. Pop up too big when clicking on question mark
When clicking a question mark, the pop up is far too big and intrusive. Needs to be styled better and be localised to the click a bit more

### 3.3. Beneficiaries - I can't click next, be more clear about issue
Beneficiaries - I can't even click `next` weirdly. It's unclear where I've gone wrong here or what info I need to add. Complete restyle of how this page presents itself and more info for the user on mandatory requirements to move to the next step

### 3.4. Executors - same as who inherits above - animations, arrow to next button
Executors - same as who inherits above - animations, arrow to `next` button, make it clear that nothing needs to be done on this page

### 3.5. Add 'minutes to complete' for each section
Add `minutes to complete` for each section

### 3.6. Add support for a charity search facility via API
Add support for a charity search facility via `API`
