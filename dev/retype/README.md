## Welcome to Retype

Retype is an ‚ú® ultra-high-performance ‚ú® static website generator that builds a website based on simple Markdown text files. Focus on your writing while Retype builds the rest.

‚ÄúRetype is the perfect fit for my user persona -
tech savvy non-devs who want to write using the best web standards out there‚Äù - jonnyfeelgood

No coding is required and just one Markdown file, such as a README.md, will get you started.

The retype.com website was generated using Retype. View the source used to generate this very page.

A new Retype powered website can be up and running within seconds once Retype is installed, which itself takes only a few seconds. üëç

# Quick start ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°

You can install Retype using npm, yarn, or the dotnet CLI.

From your command line, navigate to a folder location where you have one or more Markdown .md files, such as a GitHub project.

Next, choose one of the following tools to first install retypeapp and then start Retype by using the retype start command:

```sh
npm install retypeapp --global
retype start
```

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running.

You will require either npm, Yarn, or the dotnet CLI to be installed before installing Retype. Only one of those three is required, although all three could be installed on your machine too. It's up to you. üôå

All operating systems are supported, including Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Features
### It just works
Retype has been built to be easy to use and should "just work" out-of-the-box without any special configuration or troublesome setup.

### Lightning fast
Don't blink. Retype was built for speed.

### Easy install
Installation takes only a few seconds. Then all you need is one Markdown .md file which Retype will start building a new website from.

### Powerful
Project level configuration using retype.yml unlocks many more features and customization.

### Simple formatting
Pages are formatted using Markdown syntax and Retype components. Page level configuration is available, such as setting a custom navigation label or icon.

### Live reload
If a change is detected, such as editing and saving an .md file, your Retype website will be updated almost instantly within the browser.

### Host anywhere
Retype generates a basic HTML website that you can host on any web hosting service, or for free using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Cloudflare. No special server-side software or external dependencies are required. You can host your Retype site as a public website or as a private website within your organizations network.
